DIFFERENCE between an image and container
image + new rw-layer + additional metadata (some system limitations and settings nessesary for start) + process space (if started) = container

An image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime. Images are read-only.
A container is an active (or inactive if exited) stateful instantiation of an image.

`docker inspect image` displays detailed information (or meta-data) of container such as:
- image id
- parent images (prev layers) ids
- container (from which it has been created) id
and other

`docker create <image-id>` takes an image, add new rw layer over it.
`docker start <container-id>` starts container (create process space for it).
`docker run <image-id>` takes an image, add new rw layer over it, preparing for start (addition metadata) and starts it.

`docker inspect container` displays detailed information (or meta-data) of container such as
- container id
- state (running/paused/etc)
- image (from which it has been created) id
- path to new rw-layer
- system limitations and preferences
- network settings
and other
